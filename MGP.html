      <h1>Models of good practice</h1>
      <p> <br> <a>Logo in the top left</a>
        <br>100% of the websites researched had a clickable logo in the upper left corner of every page on the site.By this point in time it a standart I cant think of a website that had its logo somewhere else 
        <br> <br><a>Contact in top right</a>
        <br>44% have the contact button or link in the top right corner of every page. Although this placement is very common and considered best practices, it cannot be considered standard. Me and my course mates with we talked about our design decisions place our contact form in top right 

        <br><br><a>Main navigation across the top</a>
        <br>88% of the websites had the main navigation located in the header at the top of every page, making horizontal top-level navigation a web design standard.
        That is quite debatable because some of my mates from my course used vertical navigation 


        <br> <br><a><a>Responsive design</a>
        <br>68% of websites are mobile-friendly using responsive web design. This gives visitors a great experience regardless of the device – phone, tablet or desktop.We were required to make mobile first webpage on the assignment 
        
        <br><br><a>Degrade gracefully</a>
        <br>if a whizzy new feature is decided upon for users with the most modern browsers, an alternative should be provided for people with older browsers that can't deal with the technology.For example alt tags on images or videos so that user whose browser cant load that content for one or other reason can have an idea what that content is about. 

        <br><br> "Anyone who slaps a 'this page is best viewed with Browser X' label on a web page appears to be yearning for the bad old days, before the web, when you had very little chance of reading a document written on another computer, another word processor, or another network."
        Tim Berners-Lee, 1996.</a>
        <br> <br><a>Below are a few pictures of websites which influenced my design decisions </a>
      </p>
     
      <img src="Resources/img/1.jpg" alt="Image description" />

      <p>I really like the idea of black website with yellow accents so I went to google to search for some design ideas these two seemed the most appropriate to my eye so I took the idea for navigation and change the letter color to yellow to make it seem a bit more colorful , the article heading  are yellow in the pictures and I liked that so made it on my website as well it really pull your attention to read the heading and gets you interested in what follows . the “hamburger” navigation was an idea I got from Sam. I also made a logo in yellow to match the color layout . also separating the header from the body with a line made it standout more. In general this color design seems to work well for people with colorblindness because of high contrast.</p>
