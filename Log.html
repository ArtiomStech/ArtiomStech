      <h1>Experience of Term 1 </h1>
      <p>When I started the university and the web development module I was stoked to try it , quite frankly I was stoked about everything at that point. It being a my first time in England and first time in university  . I had some previous experience of creating a webpage, but it being basic whit some basic navigation, layout and some pictures for it not to feel empty. Then when I looked at an assignment brief I was generally scared that I am going to fail, it contained so many new previously unknown things it was terrifying. But as time went lectures passed it got clear what I should be doing. The assignment started coming along kind of nicely , I started making good progress on , of course my course mates made a lot easier by seeing errors mistakes I would never see making good suggestions about my design choices .there may or may not have been a few sleepless nights spent   in 24 hour room with them .all around this term was full of new interesting things that I had to learn one way or the other.</p>
