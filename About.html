      <p>The networking pathway and why chose it. The networking kind of fascinated me from the time I started understanding how computers work, then later in life I decided to deepen my knowledge on computers and try to make my choice what I want to do in life, so I went to vocational school computing pathway. While there I’ve been to some lot co-curricular activities which made my choice quite clear. I decided to go for networking as that was that seemed most interesting to me. So, I applied for Northampton university Computer network engineer pathway</p>
