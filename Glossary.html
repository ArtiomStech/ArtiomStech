      <DL>
        <DT>ASCII</DT>
        <DD>American Standard Code for Information Interchange. A code that represents English characters as numbers, ranging from 0 to 127. Used by computers and browsers, ASCII codes make it possible to transfer data from one computer to another computer.</DD>
        

            <DT>ADDRESS BAR</DT>
            <DD>The white bar towards the top of your computer screen. It will normally have something typed in it that starts with "http://" This is where you type in the address of a website that you want to visit.</DD>

                <DT>CMS</DT>
                <DD> "Content Management System". A dynamic website that is normally database driven and which enables the owner/user to manage the content of their own website (make changes) without needing to know any coding at all.</DD>
       <DT>DNS</DT>
        <DD> Stands for Domain Name Service (alternately Domain Name System or Domain Name Server). Basically, it’s the thing that converts IP addresses into domain names. DNS servers are provided with the IP address of your web server when you assign your domain name to those servers. In turn, when someone types your domain name into their web browser, those DNS servers translate the domain name to the IP address and point the browser to the correct web server.</DD>
        <DT>DOCTYPE</DT>
        <DD>The doctype declaration specifies which version of HTML is used in a document. It has a direct effect on whether your HTML will validate.</DD>
        <DT>HOST / HOSTING</DT>
        <DD> In order for you to have an email address or a website, a computer somewhere, with all the necessary software, has to provide you with 3 things: an IP (domain) address, physical space to store the information and bandwidth that accommodates the flow of information that is taking place on your behalf. The company that provides you with these facilities is your host and you will pay them a fee for hosting your site and or email address. </DD>
        <DT>EMAIL</DT>
        <DD>The internet equivalent to post and mail, email is an encoded message that is sent instantly to someone else’s computer. It is however a "best attempt" facility and not foolproof, largely because of the complexity of the internet itself and the vast number of things that can cause the process to stall or fail.</DD>
        <DT>FONT FAMILY</DT>
        <DD>Font family is a group designation for defining the typefaces used in CSS documents. The font family tag generally lists multiple fonts to be used, and usually ends with the generic font category (such as “serif” or “sans-serif”).</DD>
        <DT>HTML</DT>
        <DD> Hyper Text Markup Language. This is the base language that s used for creating websites. Common uses of the term are, "html coding" and "html website". A website created in pure html is also referred to as a static website. In other words, it does not interact with the visitor other than in the most basic ways. It stores no data and can not return data other than what is consistently on the page itself. Emails that use different fonts, colours, borders, backgrounds and graphics are also generally coded in html, with the alternative being plain text.</DD>
        <DT>HTTP</DT>
        <DD>HyperText Transfer Protocol. This is a method used to transfer information on the internet and normally precedes the "description" of the actual resource being accessed and transferred. For example, web sites and web pages are one type of resource, identified by their domain name (www.domain.com.au).</DD>
        <DT>HTTPS</DT>
        <DD>Similar to HTTP, HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol over SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or, alternately, HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. Like HTTP, it”s a set of rules for transferring hypertext requests between browsers and servers, but this time it”s done over a secure, encrypted connection.</DD>
        <DT>HYPERLINK:</DT>
        <DD> A hyperlink is a link from one web page to another, either on the same site or another one. Generally these are text or images, and are highlighted in some way (text is often underlined or put in a different colour or font weight). The inclusion of hyperlinks are the “hyper” part of “hypertext.”</DD>
        <DT>HYPERTEXT</DT>
        <DD>Hypertext is any computer-based text that includes hyperlinks. Hypertext can also include presentation devices like tables or images, in addition to plain text and links.</DD>
        <DT>IE</DT>
        <DD>Internet Explorer. The most commonly used internet browser in use, largely because it comes with Windows software and is the automatic default browser for any Windows user. The default can be changed to a different type of browser.</DD>
        <DT>IP or IP ADDRESS</DT>
        <DD>Internet Protocol. Very simply, the IP address refers to the actual number that a web address name translates to. (also see "domain"). The IP number is the real address.</DD>
        <DT>ISP</DT>
        <DD>Internet Service Provider. The company that provides you with internet access (connection) and related services is your ISP. Internode is very popular in Adelaide, South Australia</DD>
        <DT>JAVASCRIPT</DT>
        <DD>Coding languages used to achieve effects and functions on websites that normal html and its variants cannot achieve. These bits of coding (or scripts) are normally embedded into a web page and will automatically activate as soon as someone arrives on the page. Please note that JavaScript is distinctly different to Java.</DD>
        <DT>JPG</DT>
        <DD>A type of file used for images, especially photographs. Images used on web pages work best as jpg or gif.</DD>
        <DT>LAN</DT>
        <DD> Local Area Network. A method of connecting a small network of computers to each other. Using LAN enables file sharing amongst different computers and the ability to connect multiple computers to the internet using the same connection.</DD>
        <DT>LANDING PAGE</DT>
        <DD>A landing page is the page where a visitor first enters a website. Oftentimes, a special landing page is created to elicit a specific action from the new visitor (usually in connection with an advertising or marketing campaign).</DD>
        <DT>.</DT>
        <DD>A liquid layout is one that is based on percentages of the browser window’s size. The layout of the site will change with the width of the browser, even if the visitor changes their browser size while viewing the page. Liquid layouts take full advantage of a person’s browser width, optimizing the amount of content you can fit on screen at one time.</DD>
        <DT>LIQUID LAYOUT</DT>
        <DD>A liquid layout is one that is based on percentages of the browser window’s size. The layout of the site will change with the width of the browser, even if the visitor changes their browser size while viewing the page. Liquid layouts take full advantage of a person’s browser width, optimizing the amount of content you can fit on screen at one time.</DD>
        <DT>LINK</DT>
        <DD>The internet is made up of millions of resources and computers that all link to each other. One type of link (verb) is a link (noun). This is a small snippet of code that creates an area on a web page that can be clicked on. Once clicked on, the person will be taken to the resource that the piece of code linked to. This is how users on the internet can move from one web page or website to another and download documents, programmes or files. To link to something means to host this piece of code that will take the person to the resource that you are linking to. To have a link from a website means that someone else is hosting this piece of code that will bring people to your website or resource.</DD>
        <DT>META DATA</DT>
        <DD>Meta data is the data contained in the header that offers information about the web page that a visitor is currently on. The information contained in the meta data isn”t viewable on the web page (except in the source code). Meta data is contained within meta tags.</DD>
        <DT>META TAG</DT>
        <DD>Included in the head section of an html web page and is visible to search engines but not human visitors. Meta tags provide information about a web page, like the topic (title), keywords, description and also instructions to search engine robots and visitor browsers.</DD>
        <DT>NAVIGATION</DT>
        <DD> Navigation refers to the system that allows visitors to a website to move around that site. Navigation is most often thought of in terms of menus, but links within pages, breadcrumbs, related links, pagination, and any other links that allow a visitor to move from one page to another are included in navigation.</DD>
        <DT>OPERATING SYSTEM</DT>
        <DD>The type of software that you use to run a computer is the operating system.</DD>
        <DT>PHP</DT>
        <DD>A programming language that is Linux based rather than Windows based. Normally used for increased functionality on a website or to work with a database. It works in conjunction with html and html variants and allows for functions to be run from the server rather than the visitor’s browser.</DD>
        <DT>PLUG IN</DT>
        <DD> A plug-in is a bit of third party code that extends the capabilities of a website. It”s most often used in conjunction with a CMS or blogging platform. Plug-ins are a way to extend the functionality of a website without having to redo the core coding of the site. Plugins can also refer to bits of third-party software installed within a computer program to increase its functionality.</DD>
        <DT>ROOT</DT>
        <DD>In the context used here, this relates to website hosting. Often when you want to install a piece of software to work on (or run) your site, you will need "root access". This means that you have access to your hosting space at the highest level. To explain further: the information on the server is stored in different folders, arranged in a hierarchical order. The main folder in which all the other folders and sub-folders for your account are kept, is the root folder. If you go into your account on the server and can only see the main content folders, then you do not have root access.</DD>
        <DT>SCRIPT</DT>
        <DD>A piece of code that creates or enables a specific function on a website. The possible uses are endless, as are the different types of scripts that can be used, written in a variety of languages, including JavaScript.</DD>
        <DT>SEARCH ENGINE</DT>
        <DD>A programme that collects, stores, arranges and normally ranks the various resources available on the internet. It is most commonly on a website and used to find other websites – much like the yellow pages is used in the brick and mortar world.</DD>
        <DT>SEARCH ENGINE FRIENDLY</DT>
        <DD>This relates to how well a site has been put together. A search engine friendly website is one that search engines can easily read and find all the links on AND which search engines "like" because it is properly optimised and not breaking any of their rules.</DD>
        <DT>SEARCH ENGINE LISTING</DT>
        <DD> When someone searches for something using a search engine, all the sites that are listed in response to that search have a "search engine listing".</DD>
        <DT>SEARCH RESULT</DT>
        <DD>When someone searches for something using a search engine, the list of websites and links that the search engine responds with is the search result. The aim of any website is to appear high in the search result.</DD>
        <DT>SERVER</DT>
        <DD>A server is a computer that is used to house websites and provide a physical storage area for websites and emails. Without a server, your website would not be viewable to the world. Servers are normally provided by hosting companies who keep the servers in special premises, under special conditions and with permanent connections to the internet.</DD>
        <DT>SERVER SIDE</DT>
        <DD> Server-side refers to scripts run on a web server, as opposed to in a user”s browser. Server-side scripts often take a bit longer to run than a client-side script, as each page must reload when an action is taken.</DD>
        <DT>SHAREWARE</DT>
        <DD>Shareware is a piece of software that you can use free of charge for a set period. After that you have to buy it or pay a license fee in order for the software to keep working. There are different types of shareware. With some you have limited use (not everything works) before you pay, with others you have full use but for a limited time. Some shareware has both limited use and limited time.</DD>
        <DT>SITEMAP</DT>
        <DD>This is an index to all the content on a website. It is normally accessible from at least the front page of the site and is used for two purposes: to help people find what they are looking for on the site and to help search engines find all your links.</DD>
        <DT>SPAM</DT>
        <DD>somewhat controversial word which has different extremes of meaning to different people. Very simply, spam is junk mail, normally sent out in bulk and normally with no regard as to whether you want to receive it or not. Serious spammers will in fact use your protests as proof that you are seeing their emails and spam you even more.</DD>
        <DT>STABLE RELEASE:</DT>
        <DD>While BETA software is software that is in the final testing phases, a stable release is when the software has passed the beta testing phase and is considered safe for general use.</DD>
        <DT>SUBDOMAIN</DT>
        <DD>A domain that is behind another, but totally separate. Using sub-domains you can effectively have multiple "domains" on a single registered domain name and hosting account. A sub domain address would be written like: www.something-else.yourdomain.com.au The "something-else" is the sub domain.</DD>
        <DT>TAG</DT>
        <DD>A tag is a set of markup characters that are used around an element to indicate where it starts  and ends . Tags can also include HTML or other code to specify how that element should look or behave on the page</DD>
          <DT>THE NET</DT>
          <DD>A shortened version of "The Internet". Refers to the entire network that exists worldwide, making communication and information accessible to anyone with a computer and connection.</DD>
        <DT>TIMEOUT</DT>
        <DD>If you try to connect to any server on the internet – to view a website or collect email – and it takes too long, you will have a time out. It purely means it has taken too long, so the process was aborted. This is often what has happened when you get an error while trying to send or receive email, or when you try to visit a website and instead get a page that tells you the site cannot be found. Often just trying again immediately fixes the problem.</DD>
        <DT>URL</DT>
        <DD> Uniform Resource Locator. (Allows all resources on the internet to be located in a uniform manner). A URL is a website address that has all the pertinent information for finding the exact location attached to it. http://www.thinkingit.com.au is this website’s url and http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-website-terminology is this exact page’s url (notice the extra part after the .com.au)</DD>
        <DT>VALID</DT>
        <DD>Valid web pages are those that return no errors based on the type of HTML/XHTML specified in the doctype declaration at the beginning of the file. In other words, the code used on the page conforms to the specifications for that version of HTML/XHTML. This can be checked through various validation services, most commonly the one from W3C.</DD>
        <DT>WEBMAIL</DT>
        <DD> Email that you can check from any computer anywhere in the world using software on a server.</DD>
        <DT>WEB STANDARDS</DT>
        <DD>Standards are specifications recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium for standardizing website design. The main purpose of web standards is to make it easier for both designers and those who create web browsers to make sites that will appear consistent across platforms, although browsers such as IE – Internet Explorer are slow to add the latest standards for website design.</DD>
        <DT>WEB PAGE or PAGE:</DT>
        <DD>Just one page rather than a complete website (see below). A page is not the same as, for example, the page in a book. The length is not limited by a fixed height and width, but by user-friendliness, good practice and practicality.</DD>
        <DT>WEBSITE</DT>
        <DD>The actual website itself. The website is the content that dictates what people see and do when they go to your website address, normally containing a number of web pages not just one page.</DD>
        <DT>WEBSITE ADDRESS</DT>
        <DD>This is the location of your website and is normally typed as www.the-name-of-the website.com.au</DD>
        <DT>WWW</DT>
        <DD>World Wide Web. Another name for the Internet.</DD>
